## Overview

Java is Simple, High Level, Platform independent, Architecture-Neutral, Secure, Robust, Multithreaded, Distributed, and Object Oriented programming language.

## Java Characteristics

### Simple
Java is easy to learn because most of the complex or confusing features of C and C++ like pointers, operator overloading etc are not provided in Java.

### Secure
Java programs run within the JVM which protects from unauthorized or illegal access to system resources.

### Platform Independent / Portable
Java program can be executed on any kind of machine containing any CPU or any operating system.

### Architecture-neutral
Since Java applications can run on any kind of CPU so it is architecture-neutral.

### Robust
Java is robust because of following:
- Strong memory management
- No Pointers
- Exception handling and Type checking
- Platform Independent

### Multithreaded
Java supports multithreaded programming, which allows us to write programs that do many things simultaneously.

### Distributed
Using RMI and EJB we can create distributed applications in java.

### Object-oriented
Java follows object oriented programming model that helps to break the complex code into easy to understand objects.

## Programming Languages

### Language
It is the medium of communication.

### Program
It is a set of instructions for a device to perform some specific task.

### Programming Language
It contains set of grammatical rules or syntax to write a program for instructing machine to perform specific tasks.

## Types of Programming Languages

::: tip Types
1. Low Level Programming Language
2. Middle Level Programming Language
3. High Level Programming Language
:::

### Low Level Programming Languages

- Binary digits (0,1) will be used to write the instructions in Low Level Language.
- Instructions written in binary language or native language will be understood by the machine directly.
- No translator program is required.

::: warning Problem
- It is very complex to write, modify and debug the instructions written in Binary Language.
- Binary code or Native code is platform dependent.
:::

### Middle Level Programming Languages

- Assembly codes like ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, MOV etc. will be used to write the instructions in Middle Level Language.
- Instructions written in assembly language will not be understood by the machine directly.
- Assembler is a program that should be used to convert Assembly language to Machine language.

::: warning Problem
The code written in Assembly language will be processor dependent.
:::

### High Level Programming Languages

- Human understandable codes like English words will be used to write the instructions in High Level Language.
- Instructions written in High Level Language will not be understood by the machine directly.
- Compiler or Interpreter is a program that should be used to convert High Level Language to Machine language.

::: tip Advantages
It is easy to write, modify and debug the instructions written using High Level Language.

    end

    subgraph MAC OS
        MAC --> MAC_RUN(Will not be executed successfully)
    end

    subgraph Windows
        WIN --> WIN_RUN(Will not be executed successfully)
    end
```

::: danger Platform Dependent
C/C++ compiled code is platform-specific and cannot run on different operating systems.
:::

    C --> MAC[Mac OS]
    C --> LIN[Linux]

    subgraph Windows
        WIN --> JVM[Native Code]
        JVM --> WIN_RUN(Will be executed successfully)
    end

    subgraph MAC OS
        MAC --> MAC_JVM[Native Code]
        MAC_JVM --> MAC_RUN(Will be executed successfully)
    end

    subgraph Linux
        LIN --> LIN_JVM[Native Code]
        LIN_JVM --> LIN_RUN(Will be executed successfully)
    end
```

::: tip Platform Independent
Java bytecode can run on any platform with JVM - **Write Once Run Anywhere (WORA)**
:::

## Key Concepts

### What is Source Code?

Human understandable code written using High Level Programming language is called as Source Code.

### What is Native Code or Binary Code or Machine Code?

Machine understandable code written using Low Level Programming language is called as Native Code.

### What is Byte Code?

JVM understandable code generated by Java Compiler is called as Byte Code. Byte code is also called as Magic Value.

### Why C and C++ are Platform Dependent?

When you compile C or C++ program on one Operating System then compiler generates that Operating System understandable native code. This native code generated on one OS will not run on other OS directly.

### Why Java is Platform Independent?

When you compile Java program on one Operating System then Java compiler generates Byte Code. You can run that Byte code on any OS which has the JVM. JVM is understanding the Byte code and generating native code for the corresponding OS. Because of Byte code and JVM, Java is Platform Independent.

::: tip WORA
**Write Once Run Anywhere** - Java's key feature
:::

### Performance Comparison

::: details Which is faster: C/C++ or Java?

C or C++ program execution is faster than Java program.

**Reason:** Compiled code of C or C++ program contains binary code and that binary code will be executed directly whereas compiled code of Java program contains byte code and that byte code will be converted to native code first and then native code will be executed.
:::

## Java Components

### Java Compiler (javac)

Java Compiler is a program developed in C or C++ programming language with the name "javac".

**Responsibilities:**
- Check syntactical or grammatical errors of the programs
- Convert source code to byte code

### Java Interpreter (java)

Java Interpreter is a program developed in C or C++ programming language with the name "java".

**Responsibilities:**
- Convert byte code to native code line by line
- Execute that native code

::: warning Performance Note
Because of converting and executing line by line, Java program execution was slower in initial versions of java.
:::

### JIT Compiler

JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler is a component of the Java Runtime Environment.

JIT Compiler compiles or translates or converts the necessary part of the bytecode into machine code instead of converting line by line. Because of this, performance of Java program has improved.

### JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment. It is an implementation of JVM. It contains class libraries, Interpreter, JIT Compiler etc. 

::: tip
Only JRE is enough to run the Java program.
:::

### JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine. It is a specification provided by SUN Microsystem whose implementation provides an environment to run our Java applications. JVM becomes an instance of JRE at run time.

**Popular Implementations:**
- SUN JRE
- IBM JRE
- Oracle JRE
- Open JDK

### JDK (Java Development Kit)

It is a set of various utility programs which are required for developing and executing the java programs.

::: warning Platform Dependent
JDK is platform dependent. Various JDKs are provided for various Operating Systems.
:::

**Components:**
1. **Java Development Tools**
   - javac
   - java
   - javap
   - jar
   - etc
2. Source Files
3. JRE
