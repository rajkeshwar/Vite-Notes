# Introduction to Data Structures

Data structures are fundamental building blocks in computer science.  
They define **how data is stored, organized, and accessed efficiently** to perform operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and sorting.

## 🧠 What Is a Data Structure?

A **data structure** is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.  
Each structure is optimized for specific operations and use cases.

For example:
- Arrays provide fast random access but fixed size.
- Linked Lists offer dynamic resizing but slower lookups.
- Trees and Graphs efficiently model hierarchical or networked data.

## ⚙️ Classification of Data Structures

### 1. **Primitive Data Structures**
These are the basic building blocks provided by a programming language.

Examples:
- Integers  
- Floats  
- Booleans  
- Characters  

### 2. **Non-Primitive Data Structures**
These are derived from primitive types and are used to store collections or relationships between data.

#### 📦 Linear Structures
Elements are arranged sequentially — one after another.

- **Arrays**  
- **Linked Lists**  
- **Stacks**  
- **Queues**

#### 🌳 Non-Linear Structures
Elements are connected in a hierarchical or networked manner.

- **Trees**  
- **Graphs**

## 🧩 Why Learn Data Structures?

| Benefit | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Efficiency** | Helps you design algorithms that use time and memory effectively. |
| **Scalability** | Makes software handle large data gracefully. |
| **Reusability** | Many programming libraries and frameworks are built on reusable data structure patterns. |
| **Interview Readiness** | Mastering data structures is crucial for technical interviews. |

## 🧭 Learning Roadmap

Here’s the recommended order to learn from this section:

1. [Arrays](./arrays.md) — Static, sequential storage.  
2. [Linked Lists](./linked-lists.md) — Dynamic, pointer-based structure.  
3. [Trees](./trees.md) — Hierarchical storage for faster search and organization.  

> 📘 More structures like Stacks, Queues, and Graphs will be added later!

## 🧮 Example: Choosing the Right Data Structure

| Problem | Recommended Data Structure |
|----------|-----------------------------|
| Access elements by index | Array |
| Dynamic insertion/deletion | Linked List |
| Hierarchical data | Tree |
| Process elements FIFO | Queue |
| Undo/Redo feature | Stack |
